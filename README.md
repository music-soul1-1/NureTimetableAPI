# NureTimetableAPI

**NureTimetableAPI** is a project written to simplify the process of getting the schedule for students/teachers/auditories of the Kharkiv National University of Radio Electronics.

The API uses the data from [cist.nure.ua](https://cist.nure.ua) JSON API and provides a convenient way to get the schedule in JSON format. With this API you don't have to worry about invalid JSON or request time limits.

API is currently hosted for free on [MonsterASP.NET](https://www.monsterasp.net/)

🧑🏼‍💻 An **app** for Windows, Android, and Web is available [here](https://github.com/music-soul1-1/nure-timetable).
